From linux.git (and maybe also elsewhere):

Read-only:
  - For non-merge commits:
    - Average number of files modified in a non-merge commit
  - For 2-parent merge commits:
    - Minimum number of unique commits to either side
    - Total number of diverging commits (or divide by 2 to get average)
    - Average number of file changes per side
    - Percentage where either side has a rename
    - Percentage of above where no renamed file touched by other side
    - Average percentage of renamed files touched by other side
  - Other
    - What's the longest sequence of non-merge commits merged? (Use for rebase)
    - 

Making new changes:
  - If one-commit branches both changed all files (no conflicts), how long would merge take?
  - How long to rebase long sequence of commits on top of trivial change?
  - How long to rebase long sequence of commits on top of directory rename?
