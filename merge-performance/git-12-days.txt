Day 1: ort, correct basic design (in memory resolve, then update index/worktree)
Day 2: correctness, submodules
Day 3: correctness, more conflict types
Day 4: correctness, ambiguous renaming handling
Day 5: perf, rename detection -- smarter implementation (3 old things; maybe split?)
Day 6, perf, rename detection -- handle directories better (basename pref.)
Day 7: perf, smarter index update (not O(N^2))
Day 8: perf, partial index (for when no index/worktree update needed)
Day 9: perf, in-memory rebase (avoiding intermediate disk serialization)
Day 10: feature, -X mas
Day 11: feature, modified diff3
Day 12: feature, remerge-diff
