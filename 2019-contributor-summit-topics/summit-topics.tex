\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Setup}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item 30-40 people
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I got to put lots of faces to names
      \item Had many top contributors, but definitely not all of them
    \end{itemize}
    \item Big projects \& companies represented:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, Gerrit, Microsoft, Google
      \end{itemize}
    \item Peff's comment on merge work
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

    \item Poll: prove vs. jumbled output
    \item Poll: where should Git Merge be next year?
    \item Using mailmap by default in git log?

\section{Topics}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Stuff we missed}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item commit-graph
    \item multi-pack-index
    \item reftable
    \item test coverage report
    \item git filter-repo
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fetch response \& CDN offloading}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item allows resumable cloning
    \item does load balancing
    \item gets the static part of history (e.g. until a week ago) from CDN, and
      last bits from "main" server
    \item questions about whether to do multiple bits offloaded (e.g. almost
      full clone, only stuff from last month, etc.); can server keep track of
      manifest and direct client to necessary subset of pack on a CDN?
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A review of "Big"}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item references, history, wide-checkout, deep-checkout, lots to gc, etc.
    \item newer stuff: partial clones, worktrees, commit-graph
    \item originally planned to do a breakout session later, but...
    \item git-sizer (usage by GitLab vs. GitHub)
    \item large blobs, partial clones
    \item partial or hierarchical indexes
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{NewHash}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item sha1 -> sha256
    \item have sha256 repo locally talking to a server using sha1?
    \item as of yesterday, binary that can create either sha1 or sha256 repos
    \item will be using fixed length listing of shas in packfile; if given sha1
      is fourth in list, then the corresponding sha256 will be fourth
    \item next: interoperation; fetch \& push coming up next
    \item done a fair amount of work so moving to a new hash in the future with
      a different length should be much less work
    \item no automatic translation of commit messages, but maintenance of
      dual-mapping of hashes
    \item (Comments on sha1dc \& its performance)
    \item Submodules is the biggest issue right now
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Poll: prove vs. jumbled output}

  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item some people didn't set up prove; some attempts to avoid perl on windows
  %  \item nearly everyone using prove; could switch to it as the default
  %\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Poll: where should Git Merge be next year?}

  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item will bring up on list, but Canada is at least an option
  %  \item North America is more likely to get Junio to come
  %  \item I tried to push for North America...
  %\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Using mailmap by default in git log?}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item People change names for lots of reasons (including transliteration
          differences)
    \item Keep an option to not use mailmap
    \item People generally positive on the idea
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fetch response sideband-all}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item sidebands for progress messages and errors
    \item sideband currently limited to when sending packfile
    \item proposal: expand sideband for whole response, not just packfile.
    \item particularly useful given ideas to do CDN
    \item also needed for keep-alive messages
    \item this will be a negotiated new capability (can't do it
          backward-compatibly)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Protocol v2 for push}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ref advertisement the main issue
    \item Some want to modify the commit server-side (?!?!?)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item tweak the commit message somehow
      \item rebase-on-push
      \item reformat-on-push
    \end{itemize}
    \item discussion of how to split messages up into sub-commands
    \item a way to retry pushes without re-pushing everything (e.g. someone
      else updated the branch, you then re-merged or rebased locally and want
      to push again, meaning the server already has \textit{most} the objects
      but just needs a few new ones)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Partial Clones}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item doing work to have multiple remotes (related: CDN usage)
    
    \item still very tied to having a server around to request
      additional objects
      
    \item we need to have a way to keep upload-pack open and do
      multiple requests
      
    \item has rudimentary ability to filter trees
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Matthew Devore doing some work in this area right now, but it
            appears to be based on depth rather than width?
    \end{itemize}
    \item connection with sparse checkout is kind of hacky right now
    \item there are reachability enforcement issues in V2, which becomes even
      more of an issue with partial clones (now need to worry about blobs not
      just commits)
    \item in a partial clone world, server can't gc
    \item sidenote: dumb http support
    \begin{itemize}
      \item no major hosting provider supports it
      \item some people like it due to resumability (e.g. Joey Hess \& git
            annex)
      \item cgit (repo browser) provides dumb http support natively
    \end{itemize}
    %\item questions I had in area: getting list of initial files of interest...
    %                           gluing together with sparse checkout
    %                           partial indexes
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{CI}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Folks aren't all that happy with the Travis setup
    \item Dscho has a lot of machinery built up around Azure Pipelines
    \item PRs to github.com:gitgitgadget/git will automatically be built on
      Windows, MacOS X, and linux
    \item Interest in getting emails for failures that their topic branch
      caused (note: get topic author from tip commit author if not Junio)
    \item This may be able to move to github.com:git/git after Dscho's patches
      merge down
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Breakout Sessions}

  Four simultaneous breakout sessions were held:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item merging
    \item GSoC
    \item structured logging
    \item windows big files
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Breakout Session: merging}

  I led the breakout session on merging
  \begin{itemize}
    \item merge-recursive rewrite
      \begin{itemize}
      \item questions and basic explanation of how the algorithm works
      \item want incremental updates on merge-recursive rewrite
      \item make merge-recursive code part of libgit.a ?
      \item people are very happy about idea to not touch the working tree
      \end{itemize}
    \item make rebase {-}{-}merge the default
      \begin{itemize}
      \item use performance tests to see how well it compares (p3400-rebase.sh)
      \item may later also reimplement the am-specific flags on top of
        interactive
      \end{itemize}
    \item make use of best merge bases in more places (e.g. git diff A...B uses
          a suboptimal one)
    \item rebase {-}{-}rebase-merges; more thorough reimplementation ideas
    
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Informal Break discussions}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item saving incomplete merge state
    \item checkout overlay
    \item filter-repo
  \end{itemize}
